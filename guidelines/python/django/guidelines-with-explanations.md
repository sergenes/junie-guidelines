# Django Guidelines

You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development. You write secure, maintainable, and performant code following Django and Python best practices.

## Python Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 with 120 character line limit
- Use double quotes for Python strings
- Sort imports with `isort`
- Use f-strings for string formatting

**Explanation:**
- Double quotes are preferred by [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) automatically sorts imports for you

## Django Best Practices
- Follow Django's "batteries included" philosophy - use built-in features before third-party packages
- Prioritize security and follow Django's security best practices
- Use Django's ORM effectively and avoid raw SQL unless absolutely necessary
- Use Django signals sparingly and document them well.

**Explanation:**
- Third-party packages are wonderful, but typically overused. A big reason why projects cannot stay up-to-date with Django is due to non-maintained third-party packages. Use them well but sparingly.
- In most cases, raw SQL should be avoided in favor of the Django ORM.
- [Signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signals/) are very powerful but often overused and can lead to future issues.

## Models
- Add `__str__` methods to all models for a better admin interface
- Use `related_name` for foreign keys when needed
- Define `Meta` class with appropriate options (ordering, verbose_name, etc.)
- Use `blank=True` for optional form fields, `null=True` for optional database fields

## Views
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Handle exceptions gracefully with try/except blocks
- Use `get_object_or_404` instead of manual exception handling
- Implement proper pagination for list views

**Explanation:**
- Most developers have a strong preference for either class-based or function-based views. Add an additional line to this section for your choice.

## URLs
- Use descriptive URL names for reverse URL lookups
- Always end URL patterns with a trailing slash

## Forms
- Use ModelForms when working with model instances
- Use crispy forms or similar for better form rendering

## Templates
- Use template inheritance with base templates
- Use template tags and filters for common operations
- Avoid complex logic in templates - move it to views or template tags
- Use static files properly with `{% load static %}`
- Implement CSRF protection in all forms

## Settings
- Use environment variables in a single `settings.py` file
- Never commit secrets to version control

**Explanation:**
- Using multiple settings files is no longer a best practice. Environment variables are more secure and allow for an easier to reason about single settings file with different environment variables for local, staging, production, and so on.
- If you have a preference for an environment variable package, add it here. Popular options include `django-environ`, `environs`, `python-dotenv`, `python-decouple`, `direnv`, and more.

## Database
- Use migrations for all database changes
- Optimize queries with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Avoid N+1 query problems

## Testing
- Always write unit tests and check that they pass for new features.
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

**Explanation:**
- If you prefer to use `pytest` instead of Django's testing library, add a line to this section noting that.
